                <p>This was the first project I contributed to in the Hawkes Lab. I took the lead when my mentor finished his postdoc, and <b>first authored our paper, which I presented at ICRA 2025!</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Key Contributions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I designed the clutch, which was heavily inspired by a jumping robot clutch previously designed in the Hawkes Lab.</li>
                    <li>I performed many design and testing iterations of the head of the anchor itself, practicing SolidWorks, FDM 3D printing, and basic fabrication. </li>
                    <li>I acted as a liason between my mentor and my project mates to ensure that the project was on track to complete and submit by the deadline.</li>
                </ul>
